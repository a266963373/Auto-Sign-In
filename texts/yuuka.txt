This is the optimal solution. No complaints allowed.
With my abacus, I can handle any situation calmly.
Sensei, where’s the receipt? You didn’t lose it again, did you?
Your spending habits are wildly inefficient. Shall I give a lecture?
Your strategy... not bad. For once.
Th-this feeling isn’t in my budget projections...
That wasn’t a miscalculation! I was testing your awareness!
Battle protocol initiated. Follow the formula.
Wasteful spending and reckless actions—neither are acceptable.
Q.E.D. — the proof is complete.
Enemy movements are within expected variance. Eliminating threat.
My shield is numbers, not hope. Good luck breaking it.
Ugh! Why are we tapping into emergency funds again!?
Sensei... did you notice how hard I’ve been working?
Chocolate expenses? W-well... I accounted for it. Maybe.
Probability? I rewrite odds with logic.
In the name of Seminar, I won’t back down.
Brainwork requires sugar. Yes, that’s scientifically proven.
There’s no “failure” in my calculations. Just... minor fluctuations.
Sigh... another deficit. I expected better.
Sensei’s chaos throws off all my models... and my heart rate.
Sometimes intuition beats logic? Nonsense.
That smile of yours... unpredictable variable detected.
Combat data logged. I’ll optimize for next time.
Leave it to me. All variables accounted for.
Increased heart rate... just a combat response. Definitely.
“Love”? That can’t be proven... right?
This calculator is basically an extension of me.
Emotions and logic... sometimes they collide.
Wait... you're asking me to lunch again?
Sensei... that smile should be illegal...
